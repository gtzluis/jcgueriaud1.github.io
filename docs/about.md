# About me

I'm Jean-Christophe, a French Vaadin consultant. I love to integrate 3rd party add-on to solve problems that can't be solved only with the framework components.

You can contact me by [email](jean-christophe@vaadin.com) or on [Vaadin Discord](https://discord.gg/MYFq5RTbBn) as JChristophe.

You can find some add-ons I've made in the [Vaadin directory](https://vaadin.com/directory):
* [Bootstrap For Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/directory/component/bootstrap-for-vaadin): A Java API for Bootstrap components
* [Geo Location Add-on](https://vaadin.com/directory/component/geo-location-addon---vaadin-14): A fork of  Ilia Motornyi's addon updated to Vaadin 14, that gives the coordinates in Java.
* [Sortable Layout](https://vaadin.com/directory/component/sortable-layout): A Java API to reorder components easily with drag and drop.
* [MediaQuery](https://vaadin.com/directory/component/mediaquery): This add-on gives you more control from the Java side to build a responsive UI.
